# Beer recommender üç∫
A beer recommendation system using multi-armed bandit (Œµ-Greedy). This is a just for fun project created in order to **show how we can use reinforcement learning to tackle cold start problems**. Using this project, we want to answer one simple question: **can we find the optimal beer to recommend when we know nothing about an user**?

# Building the app
To build this app is as easy as run a `docker-compose` command. [Follow this instructions to install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), if you don't have it yet.

```
cd beer-recommender-mab
docker-compose up --build
```

# Screenshots
AWS is expensive and I will not host this project on cloud. But, here are some nice screenshots tho.
